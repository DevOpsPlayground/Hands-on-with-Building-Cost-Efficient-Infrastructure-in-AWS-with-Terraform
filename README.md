# Building cost effective infrastructure in cloud (AWS) with help of terraform
## Introduction
Today we will dive into building in cloud and we will provision a simple 3-tier application

We will have work with the requirements from our crazy product team and our session will include 3 steps:

- [Deploying static website using S3](lab_1/README.md)
- [Deploying application backend and creating API](lab_2/README.md)
- [Adding Database layer](lab_3/README.md)

I hope that this session will show that using cloud can be easy and cost effective.
